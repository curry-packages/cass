# The initial default path when the system is started:
# (this path is added at the end of an existing CURRYPATH value)
path=

# The number of workers (if value=0, no further processes are started):
numberOfWorkers=0

# The method to compute the fixpoint in dependency analyses. Possible values:
# simple   : simple fixpoint iteration
# wlist    : fixpoint iteration with working lists
# wlistscc : fixpoint iteration with working lists where strongly connected
#            components are computed to guide the individual iterations
fixpoint=wlist

# The command to be used to wrap the server when the system is started
# in server mode:
terminalCommand=gnome-terminal -e

# The debugging level (between 0 and 4) to show informative debugging infos.
# Meaning of the debug level:
# 0 : show nothing
# 1 : show worker activity, e.g., timings
# 2 : show server communication
# 3 : ...and show read/store information
# 4 : ...show also stored/computed analysis data
debugLevel=0

# Should the prelude be analyzed? Usually, it should be "yes".
# The value "no" is only reasonable for experimental purposes
# (e.g., to test new analyses on small programs).
prelude=yes
